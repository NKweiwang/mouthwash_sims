TO DO
=====

* It is odd that you have an R folder and a Code folder. Maybe rename
  them? e.g., "process" and "analysis". I'm not sure what is the
  distinction between these two folders.

* Update etc/README.Rmd to reflect changes to README.md.

* Add Makefile rule to clean up outputs.

* Clarify comment, "If on your own computer, use this."

* What are the files that are being downloaded in "Get data"? It would
  be helpful to know what these files are, and what they are for. 

* Add dependencies to data files in Makefile.

* Create sbatch script for running on RCC cluster.

* Add missing descriptions to steps in Makefile.

* Ideally, the Makefile should be in the same directory as the R
  scripts, or the scripts should be run so that the working directory
  is the same as the location of the scripts. Not strictly necessary,
  but avoids some confusion about file paths.

* Describe computing environment(s) where code has been tested.

* Output progress and timing for long-running steps in R data
  processing and analysis scripts. This is important to provide
  assurance to user that things are working!

* Fix Makefile so that it correctly determines which dependencies are
  missing, and which rules to run. Right now, for example, "make sims"
  will always run R/plot_mouthwash_sims.R regardless of whether the
  plots have been previously generated.

* In the README under "Instructions", give a ballpark estimate of the
  amount of storage space needed to download the data files and
  generate the outputs. Likewise, it would also be helpful to know
  (roughly) how much memory is needed to run the analyses in R.

* Whenever possible, in a script it is best to load all the necessary
  packages upfront. It is frustrating to wait hours and then have to
  re-run a script because a package was not available, or failed to
  load! This is an easy error to catch at the very beginning.
