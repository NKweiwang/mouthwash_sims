TO DO
=====

* It is odd that you have an R folder and a Code folder. Maybe rename
  them? e.g., "process" and "analysis".

* Give target file list in Data after downloading all the files.

* Update etc/README.Rmd to reflect changes to README.md.

* Replace use of detectCores().

* Add Makefile rule to clean up outputs.
